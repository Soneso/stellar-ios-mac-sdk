# SEP-0024 (Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal) Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** 2026-03-29

**SDK Version:** 3.4.6

**SEP Version:** 3.8.0

**SEP Status:** Active

**SEP URL:** https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md

## SEP Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf of users.

This improves user experience by allowing wallets and other clients to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet to go to the anchor's site.

It is based on [SEP-0006](sep-0006.md), but only supports the interactive flow, and cleans up or removes confusing artifacts.

If you are updating from SEP-0006 see the [changes from SEP-6](#changes-from-SEP-6) at the bottom of this document.

This proposal defines a standard protocol enabling the following features directly within a wallet or other Stellar client: - Deposit external assets with an anchor - Withdraw assets from an anchor - Communicate deposit & withdrawal fee structure for an anchor to the user - Handle anchor KYC .
