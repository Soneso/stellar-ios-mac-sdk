**Generated:** 2025-10-16

**SEP Version:** 1.7.4

## SEP Summary

Regulated Assets are assets that require an issuer‚Äôs approval (or a delegated third party‚Äôs approval, such as a licensed securities exchange) on a per-transaction basis.

It standardizes the identification of such assets as well as defines the protocol for performing compliance checks and requesting issuer approval.

## Implementation Gaps

üéâ **No gaps found!** All fields are implemented.

## Recommendations

‚úÖ The SDK has full compatibility with SEP-08!
- Always check authorization flags before submitting transactions
- Handle all five response statuses appropriately in client applications
- Implement proper error handling for RegulatedAssetsServiceError cases
- Use the forDomain method to discover regulated assets from stellar.toml
- For action_required responses, provide a proper UI flow for user actions
- For revised transactions, show users what was changed before submission
- For pending transactions, implement polling with appropriate timeouts
- Store approval criteria from stellar.toml to inform users of requirements
- Test with actual approval servers to ensure compatibility
