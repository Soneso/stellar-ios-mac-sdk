# SEP-0030 (Account Recovery: multi-party recovery of Stellar accounts) Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** 2025-10-10

**SEP Version:** 0.8.1
**SEP Status:** Draft
**SEP URL:** https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0030.md

## SEP Summary

This protocol defines an API that enables an individual (e.g., a user or wallet) to regain access to a Stellar account that it owns after the individual has lost its private key without providing any third party control of the account.

Using this protocol, the user or wallet will preregister the account and a phone number, email, or other form of authentication with one or more servers implementing the protocol and add those servers as signers of the account.

If two or more servers are used with appropriate signer configuration no individual server will have control of the account, but collectively, they may help the individual recover access to the account.

The protocol also enables individuals to pass control of a Stellar account to another individual.

## Implementation Gaps

🎉 **No gaps found!** All fields are implemented.

## Recommendations

✅ The SDK has excellent compatibility with SEP-30!
- Always use SEP-10 authentication to obtain JWT tokens for all recovery endpoints
- Register accounts with multiple identities (owner role required)
- Use at least 2 recovery servers with appropriate signer configuration for secure multi-party recovery
- Support multiple authentication methods (phone, email, Stellar address) for better recovery options
- Implement proper identity verification before calling recovery endpoints
- Use the sign transaction endpoint to obtain server signatures during recovery
- Poll the get account endpoint to verify account registration status
- Handle 409 Conflict errors when attempting to register already-existing accounts
- Store JWT tokens securely and refresh them when expired
- Use pagination (after parameter) when listing accounts with many registrations
- Verify network passphrase in signature responses matches expected network
- Delete account records when user no longer needs recovery service
- Support both owner and other identity roles for flexible account sharing
- Consider completing the 409 Conflict error handling implementation
