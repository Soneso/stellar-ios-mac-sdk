## SEP Summary

The `stellar.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet can find information about your organization’s Stellar integration.

By setting the home_domain of your Stellar account to the domain that hosts your `stellar.toml`, you can create a definitive link between this information and that account.

Any website can publish Stellar network information, and the `stellar.toml` is designed to be readable by both humans and machines.

If you are an anchor or issuer, the `stellar.toml` file serves a very important purpose: it allows you to publish information about your organization and token(s) that help to legitimize your offerings.

Clients and exchanges can use this information to decide whether a token should be listed.

Fully and truthfully disclosing contact and business inf.
