# SEP-0001 (Stellar Info File) Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** 2025-10-16

## SEP Summary

The `stellar.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet can find information about your organization’s Stellar integration.

By setting the home_domain of your Stellar account to the domain that hosts your `stellar.toml`, you can create a definitive link between this information and that account.

Any website can publish Stellar network information, and the `stellar.toml` is designed to be readable by both humans and machines.

If you are an anchor or issuer, the `stellar.toml` file serves a very important purpose: it allows you to publish information about your organization and token(s) that help to legitimize your offerings.

Clients and exchanges can use this information to decide whether a token should be listed.

Fully and truthfully disclosing contact and business inf.

## Implementation Gaps

🎉 **No gaps found!** All fields are implemented.

## Recommendations

✅ The SDK has full compatibility with SEP-01!
- Consider caching stellar.toml responses to reduce network requests
- Always use the secure (HTTPS) mode in production
- Handle TomlFileError cases appropriately in client applications
- For linked currency files, implement retry logic for network failures

## Legend

- ✅ **Implemented**: Field is implemented in SDK
- ❌ **Not Implemented**: Field is missing from SDK
- ⚙️ **Server**: Server-side only feature (not applicable to client SDKs)
- ✓ **Required**: Field is required by SEP specification
- (blank) **Optional**: Field is optional
