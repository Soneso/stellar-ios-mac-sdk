# SEP-0006 (Deposit and Withdrawal API) Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** 2025-11-14

**SEP Version:** 4.3.0
**SEP Status:** Active (Interactive components are deprecated in favor of SEP-24)
**SEP URL:** https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md

## SEP Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf of users.

This improves user experience by allowing wallets and other clients to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet to go to the anchor's site.

Please note that this SEP provides a normalized interface specification that allows wallets and other services to interact with anchors _programmatically_.

[SEP-24](sep-0024.md) was created to support use cases where the anchor may want to interact with users _interactively_ using a popup opened within the wallet application.

This proposal defines a standard protocol enabling the following features directly within a wallet or other Stellar client: - Deposit external assets with an anchor - Withdraw assets from an anchor - Execute.

## Implementation Gaps

🎉 **No gaps found!** All fields are implemented.

## Recommendations

✅ The SDK has full compatibility with SEP-06!
- Always use SEP-10 authentication for production deployments
- Handle all transaction statuses appropriately in client applications
- Implement proper error handling for all TransferServerError cases
- Use SEP-38 quote endpoints for cross-asset transfers
- Monitor transaction status changes via on_change_callback
- Validate all input parameters before making requests

## Legend

- ✅ **Implemented**: Field is implemented in SDK
- ❌ **Not Implemented**: Field is missing from SDK
- ⚙️ **Server**: Server-side only feature (not applicable to client SDKs)
- ✓ **Required**: Field is required by SEP specification
- (blank) **Optional**: Field is optional
